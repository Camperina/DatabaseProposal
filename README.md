# DatabaseProposal
Photography Studio Database Proposal for Database Management Systems (ITE327)

In this class we were given a scenario for which we had to create a database. The project was broken into two phases.

In phase 1, we had to introduce the problem, propose a solution, have a database design. The design portion included 
a data dictionary, cross-reference table, an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), and a ERD Relational Model.

Phase 2 added to what was written for phase 1. The additions were functional dependencies, constraints, relational 
forms, and a normalized relational database. For this reason, only the phase 2 document is shared.
